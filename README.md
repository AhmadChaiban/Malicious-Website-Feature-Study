## Project Structure 

There are several notebooks of interest for our study, they are highlighted below, 

* `initial_notebook.ipynb` is where some early investigation was done. 
* `Dataset_notebook.ipynb` contains the initial look at 25 datasets. 
* `Dataset_20_phase_1_tests.ipynb` &  `Dataset_20_phase_2_ML.ipynb`, these notebooks pertain to the analysis and ML done on A.K. Singh's dataset. 
* `dataset_surtur.ipynb` deals with our custom dataset GAWAIN. It continues its creation, performs some rounds of ML on it and saves a final copy of it wich can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Uk03X8vFIIMRaOT9oFUhs7JuSnR6OVd0?usp=sharing" target=_blank>here<a>.
* `ML_table.ipynb` is the final notebook where XGBoost was trained on the different feature types and their combinations.
